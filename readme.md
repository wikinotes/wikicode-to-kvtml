Wikicode to KVTML Converter
===========================

What's a good snazzy name for this? Anyways, this is (will be) a Python script for converting from wikicode to kvtml (the format used by the open source word quiz / flash card software kwordquiz). Useful for quizzing yourself on stuff etc. Used extensively (or will be) on [Open Courses](http://www.wikinotes.ca). So you can make a dictionary-like list of things and then easily quiz yourself on it afterwards.

Usage
=====

Instructions on how to use it ... will be put up after the actual program is done

Examples
========

There will be sample wikicode provided as well as the expected output for the sample. Also, links to quizzes on wikinotes that were created using this software.

To do
=====
*   Needs snazzy name lol
*   Convert from Java to Python rofl
*   Ability to adapt to different formats
*   Examples:

       *'''Blah blah''': blah blah blah
       *'''Blah blah''' blah blah blah
       *Blah blah: blah blah blah
    
    Okay I know that isn't exactly a huge variety of formats but whatever can't think of any others right now
